<!-- Q.5 Difference between class & function based component -->






<!-- The main difference between class-based components and function-based components in React lies in their syntax, lifecycle methods, and state management. Here's a breakdown of the key distinctions:

1. Syntax:
   - Class-based components: Class components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the base `React.Component` class. They use the `class` keyword and require a `render()` method to return JSX.
   - Function-based components: Function components are defined as JavaScript functions. They accept `props` as an input and return JSX to describe the component's structure and content. Function components are simpler and have a more concise syntax compared to class components.

2. State and Lifecycle Methods:
   - Class-based components: Class components can maintain an internal state using the `this.state` object. They have access to the complete set of lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, `componentWillUnmount()`, etc. These methods allow developers to handle component initialization, state updates, and perform side effects.
   - Function-based components: Function components can utilize React Hooks, specifically the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, to manage state and handle lifecycle-like behavior. The `useState` hook allows functional components to have local state, and the `useEffect` hook replaces the lifecycle methods for side effects and subscriptions.

3. Readability and Code Length:
   - Class-based components: Class components tend to have more verbose syntax due to the requirement of extending the base `React.Component` class and defining methods explicitly. They may result in longer code compared to function components.
   - Function-based components: Function components have a simpler and more concise syntax. They typically require fewer lines of code compared to class components, making them easier to read and understand.

4. Performance:
   - Class-based components: Class components have a slightly higher performance overhead compared to function components because of the additional internal mechanisms required for maintaining state and lifecycle management.
   - Function-based components: Function components, especially with the use of React Hooks, are optimized for performance. They eliminate the need for some internal mechanisms of class components, resulting in potential performance improvements.

5. Context and Higher-Order Components:
   - Class-based components: Class components can use the Context API and higher-order components (HOCs) for certain advanced use cases. Context allows for the sharing of data across the component tree, and HOCs provide a way to enhance component functionality and code reuse.
   - Function-based components: Function components can also utilize the Context API and HOCs when needed. React Hooks, such as `useContext`, can be used to consume context values directly within function components.

In recent versions of React, the React team has recommended the use of function-based components and React Hooks as the preferred approach. Function components, with the help of Hooks, provide a more concise and intuitive way to write components and manage state and side effects. However, class components are still supported and widely used, especially in older codebases or when specific features like lifecycle methods are necessary. -->
