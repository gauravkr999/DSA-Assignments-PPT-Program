<!-- Q.1 What are hooks in react? how to identify hooks? -->




<!-- In React, hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to write stateful logic without using class components. Hooks provide a more concise and flexible way to manage component state and lifecycle events.

There are several built-in hooks provided by React, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, and many more. These hooks are identified by their naming convention. Each hook starts with the prefix "use" followed by the name of the feature it provides. For example:

1. useState: This hook allows you to add state to functional components. It returns a stateful value and a function to update that value.

2. useEffect: This hook enables you to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually updating the DOM. It runs after every render.

3. useContext: This hook allows you to access the value of a context in a functional component. It accepts a context object created by React.createContext and returns the current context value.

To identify hooks, you can look for function calls that start with "use" within a functional component. Additionally, React enforces certain rules of using hooks. For example, hooks can only be called at the top level of a functional component or within other custom hooks.

It's important to note that hooks should always be called in the same order, as React relies on the order of hooks to maintain their state and associations with components. -->
