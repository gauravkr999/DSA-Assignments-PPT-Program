<!-- Q.3 How to pass data from one component to another component -->





<!-- In React, there are several ways to pass data from one component to another component. Here are some commonly used approaches:

1. **Props**: You can pass data from a parent component to a child component using props. Props are essentially properties that you define on a component and pass values to when rendering the component. Here's an example:

   ```jsx
   // ParentComponent.jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

   function ParentComponent() {
     const data = 'Hello from Parent'; -->

     return <ChildComponent data={data} />;
   <!-- }

   // ChildComponent.jsx
   import React from 'react';

   function ChildComponent(props) {
     return <p>{props.data}</p>;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `data` variable is passed as a prop from the `ParentComponent` to the `ChildComponent` using the `data` prop. The `ChildComponent` can access and use the data through `props.data`.

2. **Context**: React's Context API allows you to create a context and share data with multiple components in the component tree without passing props explicitly at each level. Context provides a way to share data implicitly between components. Here's an example:

   ```jsx
   // DataContext.js
   import React from 'react';

   const DataContext = React.createContext();

   export default DataContext;

   // ParentComponent.jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';
   import DataContext from './DataContext';

   function ParentComponent() {
     const data = 'Hello from Parent'; -->

     return (
       <DataContext.Provider value={data}>
         <ChildComponent />
       </DataContext.Provider>
     <!-- );
   }

   // ChildComponent.jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import DataContext from './DataContext';

   function ChildComponent() {
     const data = React.useContext(DataContext);

     return <p>{data}</p>;
   }
   ```

   In this example, a `DataContext` is created using `React.createContext()`. The `data` value is provided as the value of the context provider. The `ChildComponent` can access the data using the `useContext` hook and `DataContext`.

3. **State Management Libraries**: If you have complex state management needs or want to share data across different parts of your application, you can use state management libraries like Redux or MobX. These libraries provide a centralized store to manage application state and enable components to access and modify the shared data.

   State management libraries typically involve creating a store, defining actions to update the state, and connecting components to the store to access the required data. The specifics of implementing state management depend on the library you choose.

These are just a few approaches to pass data between components in React. The choice of method depends on the complexity of your application, the relationship between the components, and your specific requirements. -->
