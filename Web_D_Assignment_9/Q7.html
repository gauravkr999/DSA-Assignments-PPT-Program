<!-- Q.7 How do you handle conditional rendering in React? -->




<!-- In React, conditional rendering refers to the process of displaying different content or components based on certain conditions. There are several ways to handle conditional rendering in React:

1. **Using if statements and variables**: You can use regular JavaScript if statements or ternary operators to conditionally render content. This approach involves declaring variables or using inline expressions to determine what to render. Here's an example:

   ```jsx
   function MyComponent() {
     const isLoggedIn = true;

     return (
       <div>
         {isLoggedIn ? <p>Welcome, User!</p> : <p>Please log in.</p>}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   In this example, the JSX expression inside the curly braces `{}` evaluates the condition `isLoggedIn` and renders the appropriate content based on the result.

2. **Using && operator**: The `&&` operator can be used for conditional rendering when you only want to render a single element or component based on a condition. Here's an example:

   ```jsx
   function MyComponent() {
     const showContent = true;

     return (
       <div>
         {showContent && <p>Content to be rendered.</p>}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   In this example, if `showContent` is `true`, the content inside the `&&` expression will be rendered. Otherwise, nothing will be rendered.

3. **Using the ternary operator**: The ternary operator (`condition ? trueValue : falseValue`) is useful when you need to choose between two different components or elements based on a condition. Here's an example:

   ```jsx
   function MyComponent() {
     const isPremiumUser = true;

     return (
       <div>
         {isPremiumUser ? <PremiumComponent /> : <RegularComponent />}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   In this example, if `isPremiumUser` is `true`, the `<PremiumComponent />` will be rendered; otherwise, the `<RegularComponent />` will be rendered.

4. **Using if-else statements**: In certain cases, if-else statements can be used for more complex conditional rendering logic. However, unlike the previous examples, this approach is not within JSX. Instead, you can use if-else statements to determine which JSX to return. Here's an example:

   ```jsx
   function MyComponent() {
     const isLoggedIn = true;

     if (isLoggedIn) {
       return <p>Welcome, User!</p>;
     } else {
       return <p>Please log in.</p>;
     }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the if-else statement is used outside the JSX to conditionally return different JSX elements based on the value of `isLoggedIn`.

These are just a few examples of how you can handle conditional rendering in React. The approach you choose depends on the complexity of the conditions and the desired output. Remember that conditional rendering allows you to dynamically show or hide components or content based on specific conditions, making your React application more flexible and interactive. -->
