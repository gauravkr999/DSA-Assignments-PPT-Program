<!-- To build a responsive image gallery using CSS Grid and media queries, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up the basic HTML structure of your webpage by creating an HTML file and adding the necessary HTML tags (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`).

2. In the `<head>` section, link the necessary CSS file using the `<link>` tag, or you can include the CSS code directly within `<style>` tags.

3. Inside the `<body>` section, create a `<div>` element with a class or ID to serve as the container for your image gallery.

4. Within the gallery container, add multiple `<img>` elements, each representing an image in your gallery. Make sure to specify appropriate `src` attributes with the paths to your images.

5. Apply CSS Grid to create the desired layout for your image gallery. Define the grid template columns to control the number of images per row. For example, if you want three images per row on large screens, you can set the `grid-template-columns` property to `repeat(3, 1fr)`.

6. Use media queries to make the image gallery responsive. Define a breakpoint where you want the gallery to switch to a single column layout. For example, you can set a breakpoint at 600 pixels and change the `grid-template-columns` property to `1fr` to collapse the gallery into a single column on small screens.

Here's an example of the HTML structure and CSS code to achieve this: -->

HTML:
```html
<div class="image-gallery">
  <img src="path/to/image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="path/to/image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="path/to/image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
  <!-- Add more images as needed -->
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.image-gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .image-gallery {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```
/* 
In this example, the `.image-gallery` class represents the container for the image gallery. It uses `display: grid` to activate CSS Grid. The `grid-template-columns` property is set to `repeat(3, 1fr)` for large screens, which creates three equal-width columns. The `gap` property adds a 10-pixel gap between images. In the media query, for screens with a maximum width of 600 pixels, the `grid-template-columns` property is changed to `1fr`, collapsing the gallery into a single column layout.

Adjust the CSS code according to your specific design preferences, image sizes, and any additional styling requirements.

Remember to replace the `"path/to/imageX.jpg"` with the actual paths or URLs to your images.

By using CSS Grid and media queries, this approach ensures that the image gallery adapts and remains visually appealing on both large and small screens. The number of images per row adjusts automatically based on the available screen space, providing an optimal viewing experience. */
