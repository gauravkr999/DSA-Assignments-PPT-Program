<!-- Q.1 What is a Media Query in CSS, and what is its purpose? -->



<!-- A media query in CSS is a feature that allows you to apply different styles to a webpage based on certain conditions, such as the characteristics of the device or the viewport size. It allows you to create responsive web designs that adapt and display correctly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

The purpose of media queries is to provide a way to target specific devices or viewport sizes and apply custom styles or adjust the layout accordingly. By using media queries, you can define different CSS rules for different devices or screen sizes, ensuring that your website or application looks and functions well on various screen resolutions and orientations.

Media queries use the `@media` rule in CSS and allow you to specify conditions using different parameters, such as width, height, aspect ratio, device type, and more. When the specified conditions are met, the CSS rules within the media query block are applied, overriding or modifying the default styles of the webpage.

Here's an example of a media query that changes the background color of a webpage when the viewport width is less than or equal to 600 pixels:

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```

In this example, the background color of the `body` element will be set to `lightblue` only when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less. This allows you to create a different layout or style specifically for smaller screens or devices.

Overall, media queries are essential for creating responsive and mobile-friendly designs, enabling you to adapt your website's appearance and behavior to different devices and screen sizes. -->
