<!-- Q.2 How do you define a media query in CSS? -->


<!-- To define a media query in CSS, you use the `@media` rule followed by the conditions that you want to target. Here's the general syntax for defining a media query:

```css
@media (condition) {
  /* CSS rules to apply when the condition is met */
}
```

The condition is specified inside parentheses and consists of one or more media features and their corresponding values. Media features represent the characteristics of the device or viewport you want to target, such as screen size, device width, orientation, etc.

Here's an example of a media query that targets screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens up to 768 pixels wide */
}
```

In this example, the CSS rules within the media query block will only apply when the maximum width of the viewport is 768 pixels or less.

You can also combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `and` and `or` to create more complex media queries. For instance, you can target screens with a minimum width of 600 pixels and a maximum width of 1024 pixels using the `and` operator:

```css
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  /* CSS rules for screens between 600 and 1024 pixels wide */
}
```

By defining different media queries, you can specify different styles or layout adjustments for various screen sizes, devices, or other characteristics, making your website responsive and adaptable to different environments. -->
