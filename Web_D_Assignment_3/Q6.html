<!-- To get started, follow these steps:

1. Set up the basic structure of your HTML document by creating an HTML file and adding the necessary HTML tags (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`).

2. In the `<head>` section, add the appropriate meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings to ensure proper rendering on different devices. You can use the following meta tags as a starting point: -->

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
<!-- 
3. Add the required CSS and JavaScript files to your project. You can either host the files locally or link to external files (e.g., via CDNs). You can inspect the provided one-page landing page to identify the CSS and JavaScript files used and include them in your project.

4. Build the structure of your webpage's content within the `<body>` section. Refer to the provided landing page for reference and replicate the structure using HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<div>`, etc. Use appropriate classes and IDs to target elements for styling and interactivity.

5. To showcase a video prominently on the page, you can use the HTML `<video>` element. Specify the source of the video using the `<source>` element nested within the `<video>` element. Don't forget to add the `controls` attribute to allow users to control video playback. Here's an example:

```html -->
<video controls>
  <source src="path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
<!-- 
Replace `"path/to/video.mp4"` with the actual path or URL to your video file.

6. Apply CSS styles to replicate the visual design of the landing page. You'll need to inspect the styles used on the provided landing page and recreate them in your CSS file or `<style>` tags within the `<head>` section. Use appropriate selectors and properties to style the elements accordingly.

7. Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure your webpage adapts to different viewport sizes and devices. Define breakpoints and adjust the layout and styles accordingly using CSS rules within media queries. Refer to the earlier discussion on media queries for guidance.

Remember to test your webpage on different devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and visually appealing experience. -->
