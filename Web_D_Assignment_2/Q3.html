<!-- Q.3 What is VW/VH ? -->

<!-- VW and VH are units of measurement in CSS that represent a percentage of the viewport size. Here's what they stand for:

1. VW (Viewport Width):
   - 1 VW is equal to 1% of the width of the viewport.
   - For example, if the width of the viewport is 1000 pixels, 1 VW would be equivalent to 10 pixels (1% of 1000 pixels).
   - VW units are useful for creating fluid and responsive layouts based on the width of the viewport.

2. VH (Viewport Height):
   - 1 VH is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport.
   - For example, if the height of the viewport is 800 pixels, 1 VH would be equivalent to 8 pixels (1% of 800 pixels).
   - VH units are also helpful for creating responsive designs and adjusting elements based on the height of the viewport.

These units allow you to create flexible and adaptive designs that scale with the size of the viewport. They are particularly useful for responsive web development, where the layout and elements need to adjust dynamically to different screen sizes and resolutions. By using VW and VH units, you can create designs that adapt to various devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.
