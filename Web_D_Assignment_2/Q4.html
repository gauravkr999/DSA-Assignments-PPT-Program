<!-- Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ? -->



<!-- The differences between inline, inline-block, and block are related to how they affect the layout and behavior of elements within the document flow. Here's a breakdown of each display property:

1. Inline:
   - Inline elements do not create line breaks before or after themselves. They flow along with the surrounding text or other inline elements.
   - Inline elements do not have a specified width and height. Their dimensions are determined by their content.
   - Margin and padding values on inline elements only affect the left and right sides, not the top and bottom.
   - Examples of inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, and `<img>`.

2. Inline-block:
   - Inline-block elements behave like inline elements in that they flow within the text or other inline elements, but they also respect height, width, margin, and padding properties.
   - Inline-block elements can have a specified width and height, allowing them to be sized like block elements.
   - Inline-block elements do not create line breaks before or after themselves.
   - Examples of inline-block elements include `<input>`, `<button>`, and `<select>`.

3. Block:
   - Block elements create line breaks before and after themselves, causing them to start on a new line and take up the full width available.
   - Block elements can have a specified width and height, and they can also have margins, paddings, and borders that affect all sides.
   - Block elements create a block-level formatting context, which means they can contain both inline and block-level elements.
   - Examples of block elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`.

Inline elements flow with the surrounding text, do not create line breaks, and have no specified width or height. Inline-block elements behave like inline elements but can have specified dimensions and respect margin and padding. Block elements create line breaks, take up the full width available, and have specified dimensions, as well as margins, paddings, and borders that affect all sides. -->
