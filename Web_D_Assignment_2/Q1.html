<!-- Q.1 What’s Box Model in CSS ?  -->



<!-- The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margins, padding, and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model. 

Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them are given below: 

Content: This contains the actual data in the form of text, images, or other media forms and it can be sized using the width & height property.
Padding: This property is used to create space around the element, inside any defined border.
Border: This property is used to cover the content & any padding, & also allows setting the style, color, and width of the border.
