<!-- Q.10 What is the purpose of the spread operator (...) in ES6? -->






<!-- In ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the spread operator (`...`) has multiple uses and serves various purposes. It provides a concise and flexible syntax for working with arrays, objects, and function arguments. Here are some common use cases and purposes of the spread operator:

1. Array Spread:
   The spread operator can be used to expand an array into individual elements. It allows you to create a new array by including all the elements from another array or combining multiple arrays together.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

   const combinedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];
   console.log(combinedArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

   The spread operator is particularly useful when working with functions that expect individual arguments but have an array as input.

2. Object Spread:
   The spread operator can also be used to create a new object by combining properties from multiple objects. It allows you to shallow copy object properties or merge objects together.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const obj1 = { foo: 'bar' };
   const obj2 = { baz: 'qux' };

   const combinedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
   console.log(combinedObject); // { foo: 'bar', baz: 'qux' }
   ```

   When merging objects, if there are properties with the same name, the right-most property takes precedence.

3. Function Arguments:
   The spread operator can be used to pass an array of values as individual arguments to a function. This is useful when you have an array of values and need to invoke a function that expects separate arguments.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function sum(a, b, c) {
     return a + b + c;
   }

   const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
   const result = sum(...numbers);
   console.log(result); // 6
   ```

   In the example above, the spread operator is used to expand the `numbers` array into individual arguments, which are then passed to the `sum()` function.

4. Array and Object Destructuring:
   The spread operator can be used in conjunction with array and object destructuring to assign the remaining elements to a new variable.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const [first, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   console.log(first); // 1
   console.log(rest); // [2, 3, 4, 5]

   const { x, y, ...restObj } = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3, w: 4 };
   console.log(x); // 1
   console.log(y); // 2
   console.log(restObj); // { z: 3, w: 4 }
   ```

   In the array destructuring example, the spread operator (`...rest`) assigns the remaining elements to the `rest` variable. Similarly, in the object destructuring example, the spread operator (`...restObj`) assigns the remaining properties to the `restObj` variable.

The spread operator (`...`) in ES6 provides a powerful and versatile tool for working with arrays, objects, and function arguments. It simplifies tasks like combining arrays, merging objects, passing multiple arguments, and handling remaining elements during destructuring. -->
