<!-- Q.5 What is the difference between let and const ? -->





<!-- The main difference between `let` and `const` in JavaScript is in their reassignability.

1. Reassignability:
   - `let`: Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned to new values. This means you can assign a new value to a `let` variable at any point after its declaration.
   
   For example:
   ```javascript
   let x = 5;
   x = 10; // Reassignment is allowed
   ```

   - `const`: Variables declared with `const` are read-only constants. Once assigned, the value of a `const` variable cannot be changed or reassigned. Any attempt to reassign a `const` variable will result in a `TypeError`.

   For example:
   ```javascript
   const x = 5;
   x = 10; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
   ```

   It's important to note that while `const` variables themselves are immutable, it does not make the value they hold immutable. If the value is an object or array, its properties or elements can still be modified.

2. Block Scope:
   Both `let` and `const` have block scope. This means that they are only accessible within the block of code where they are defined, such as inside a loop, conditional statement, or block enclosed by curly braces `{}`. They are not accessible outside of that block.

3. Hoisting:
   Both `let` and `const` are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. However, unlike variables declared with `var`, they remain uninitialized and in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until the actual declaration. Accessing `let` or `const` variables before their declaration will result in a `ReferenceError`.

4. Initialization:
   - `let`: Variables declared with `let` are not automatically initialized with a value. They start in an uninitialized state and need to be explicitly assigned a value before being accessed.
   
   For example:
   ```javascript
   let x;
   console.log(x); // undefined
   x = 5;
   ```

   - `const`: Variables declared with `const` must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration. They cannot be left uninitialized.

   For example:
   ```javascript
   const x = 5;
   ```

   It's important to note that the initialization of `const` variables is a requirement, not an option.

In summary, `let` allows reassignment and is useful for variables that need to be changed, while `const` creates read-only constants that cannot be reassigned. It's a best practice to use `const` for values that should remain constant and `let` for values that may need to be changed. -->
