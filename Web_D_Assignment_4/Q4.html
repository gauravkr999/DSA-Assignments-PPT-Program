<!-- Q.4 What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6? -->




<!-- ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, brought several significant features and enhancements to the JavaScript language. Here are some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6:

1. let and const: The `let` and `const` keywords were introduced to provide block-scoping for variables. Variables declared with `let` have block scope, while variables declared with `const` are block-scoped constants that cannot be reassigned.

2. Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have lexical `this` binding and do not create their own `this` context.

3. Enhanced Object Literals: Object literals gained new capabilities, such as shorthand syntax for defining object properties and methods, computed property names, and method definition shorthand.

4. Classes: ES6 introduced class syntax for creating objects with constructor functions and prototypal inheritance. Classes provide a more familiar and structured way to define objects and their behavior.

5. Template Literals: Template literals allow the embedding of expressions inside strings using backticks (` `). They support multi-line strings, string interpolation, and expression evaluation.

6. Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring allows extracting values from arrays or objects into individual variables using a concise syntax. It simplifies assignments and function parameter handling.

7. Default Parameters: Default function parameters allow specifying default values for function arguments if no value or `undefined` is passed. It eliminates the need for explicit checks or assignments.

8. Rest and Spread Operators: The rest operator (`...`) allows capturing multiple function arguments into an array, while the spread operator (`...`) spreads the elements of an array or iterable into individual arguments or array elements.

9. Promises: Promises provide a standardized way to handle asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell. They simplify asynchronous programming and improve code readability.

10. Modules: ES6 introduced native support for modules, allowing JavaScript code to be organized into separate files. Modules provide encapsulation, reusability, and better dependency management.

11. Iterators and Generators: Iterators allow defining custom iteration behavior for objects, while generators provide a simpler syntax for creating iterators. They enable iterable objects and simplified asynchronous programming with `async` and `await` keywords.

12. Enhanced Array Manipulation: ES6 introduced several new methods for array manipulation, such as `find()`, `findIndex()`, `includes()`, `fill()`, `from()`, and `entries()`, which provide more flexibility and convenience.

These are just some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6. ES6 brought a significant overhaul to JavaScript, improving its syntax, readability, and capabilities, making it more powerful and developer-friendly. Subsequent versions of ECMAScript have continued to introduce new features and enhancements to the language. -->
