<!-- Q.4 Explain OOPS ?  -->




<!-- OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System, and it is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes. OOPS focuses on creating reusable, modular, and maintainable code by representing real-world entities as objects with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

The key concepts of OOPS are:

1. Classes: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates data (attributes) and operations (methods) that can be performed on those objects. Objects are instances of classes.

2. Objects: Objects are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities and have their own unique identity, state (data/attributes), and behavior (methods). Objects can interact with each other by invoking methods and exchanging data.

3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together within a class, hiding internal implementation details and providing a clean external interface. It allows for data abstraction and information hiding, promoting modularity and security.

4. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It enables code reuse and promotes the hierarchical organization of classes. The derived class (subclass) inherits the characteristics of the base class (superclass) and can add or override them as needed.

5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It provides flexibility by allowing methods to be implemented differently in different classes while sharing a common interface. Polymorphism enables code to be written in a more generic and flexible manner.

6. Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by representing the relevant features and hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on defining essential properties and behaviors without getting into the implementation specifics. Abstraction allows for modular design and helps manage complexity.

The benefits of using OOPS include code reusability, modularity, maintainability, scalability, and improved organization of code. OOPS promotes a structured approach to software development, making it easier to understand, extend, and modify code over time.

Languages such as Java, C++, C#, and Python are widely used for object-oriented programming, providing built-in support for classes, objects, and OOPS principles. -->
