<!-- Q.7  Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it? -->





<!-- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It enables code reuse and promotes the hierarchical organization of classes, forming an "is-a" relationship between classes. The class that inherits from another class is called the subclass or derived class, while the class being inherited from is called the superclass or base class.

The purpose of inheritance is to facilitate code reuse, promote modularity, and create a hierarchy of classes that share common characteristics. It allows the derived class to inherit the attributes and methods of the base class, reducing code duplication and promoting a more organized and structured codebase.

Here are a few key aspects and benefits of inheritance:

1. Code reuse: Inheritance allows the derived class to inherit attributes and behaviors from the base class, reducing the need to rewrite code. It promotes reuse of existing code, as the derived class automatically includes the characteristics of the base class.

2. Modularity: Inheritance promotes modularity by organizing classes into a hierarchical structure. Related classes can be grouped together, with shared properties and methods defined in the base class. This improves the organization and maintainability of code.

3. Overriding and extension: Inheritance enables the derived class to override methods of the base class to provide specialized implementations. This allows customization and extension of functionality while maintaining the core behavior defined in the base class.

4. Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely tied to polymorphism. The derived class can be treated as an object of the base class, allowing for substitution and the ability to write code that operates on a general base class while accommodating different derived classes.

5. Inheritance hierarchies: Inheritance supports the creation of hierarchical structures, where classes can be organized into parent-child relationships. This allows for the creation of specialized classes that inherit from more general classes, enabling a flexible and extensible design.

By using inheritance, developers can create a hierarchy of classes, define common characteristics in base classes, and reuse code effectively. It promotes modularity, code organization, and extensibility, making it easier to understand, maintain, and evolve software systems. -->
