<!-- Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ? -->






<!-- Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together within a class, and controlling access to them from outside the class. It is a mechanism for combining data and the operations that manipulate that data into a single unit, known as an object. The purpose of encapsulation is to provide data abstraction, information hiding, and to ensure the integrity and security of an object's internal state.

Here are the key aspects and purposes of encapsulation:

1. Data abstraction: Encapsulation allows you to define the essential properties and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary implementation details. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it, providing a clear and simplified interface for interacting with the object.

2. Information hiding: Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of an object from the external world. The object exposes only the necessary methods and properties, while keeping the internal state and implementation hidden. This prevents external code from directly manipulating or accessing the object's internal data, promoting data integrity and security.

3. Access control: Encapsulation provides control over the access to the internal members of an object. By using access modifiers (such as public, private, and protected), you can define which members are accessible to the outside world and which are restricted to the class itself. This allows you to enforce encapsulation and maintain the integrity of the object's internal state.

4. Code maintainability: Encapsulation improves code maintainability by localizing the impact of changes. Since the internal details of an object are hidden, modifications to the internal implementation can be made without affecting the code that uses the object. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs and makes it easier to update or extend the functionality of the object.

5. Code reusability: Encapsulation facilitates code reusability by encapsulating related data and methods into a single object. Objects can be created from classes and reused in different parts of the codebase, promoting modular design and reducing code duplication.

6. Code organization and readability: Encapsulation helps in organizing code by grouping related data and behaviors into cohesive units. This improves code readability, as the object's interface provides a clear understanding of how to interact with the object without needing to know the internal implementation details.

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of OOP that provides data abstraction, information hiding, and access control. It promotes code maintainability, reusability, and improved organization, leading to more robust and secure software systems. -->
