<!-- Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose? -->




<!-- The "this" keyword in object-oriented programming refers to the current instance of a class. It is a reference to the object on which a method or constructor is being invoked. The purpose of the "this" keyword is to differentiate between instance variables and parameters or local variables within a class.

Here are a few important uses of the "this" keyword:

1. Distinguishing between instance variables and local variables: If a method or constructor has a parameter or local variable with the same name as an instance variable, using "this" allows you to differentiate between them. "this" resolves the ambiguity by referring to the instance variable. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int value;

    public void setValue(int value) {
        this.value = value; // 'this' refers to the instance variable
    }
}
```

2. Invoking other constructors: Within a constructor, the "this" keyword can be used to invoke another constructor in the same class. This is known as constructor chaining. It allows you to reuse code and provide different ways to create objects. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int value;

    public MyClass() {
        this(0); // Invokes the parameterized constructor with value 0
    }

    public MyClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}
```

3. Returning the current instance: Methods can use the "this" keyword to return the current instance of the class, allowing for method chaining. This is known as fluent or cascading interface design. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int value;

    public MyClass setValue(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        return this;
    }

    public void printValue() {
        System.out.println(value);
    }
}
```

Using the "this" keyword provides clarity and helps to avoid naming conflicts, particularly when working with instance variables and parameters or local variables that share the same name. It allows for better readability and enables the distinction between different scopes within a class. -->
