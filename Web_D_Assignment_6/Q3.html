<!-- Q.3 Whatâ€™s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them -->





<!-- The `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` methods are used in JavaScript to explicitly set the value of `this` within a function and to invoke functions with a specific context. While they serve a similar purpose, there are differences in how they are used and how arguments are passed to the target function.

1. `call()`: The `call()` method is used to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments passed as comma-separated values. The first argument to `call()` is the value that will be bound to `this`, and subsequent arguments are passed directly as parameters to the function. For example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! I am ${this.title}`);
}

const person = {
    title: 'Mr.'
};

greet.call(person, 'John'); // Output: Hello, John! I am Mr.
```

2. `apply()`: The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it accepts arguments as an array or an array-like object. The first argument to `apply()` is the value to be bound to `this`, and the second argument is an array-like object containing the arguments to be passed to the function. For example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! I am ${this.title}`);
}

const person = {
    title: 'Mr.'
};

greet.apply(person, ['John']); // Output: Hello, John! I am Mr.
```

3. `bind()`: The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when invoked, has a bound `this` value and, optionally, pre-specified arguments. It does not immediately invoke the function but returns a new function with the bound context. The `bind()` method is useful when you want to create a function with a specific `this` value that can be called later. For example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! I am ${this.title}`);
}

const person = {
    title: 'Mr.'
};

const boundGreet = greet.bind(person);
boundGreet('John'); // Output: Hello, John! I am Mr.
```

The key differences between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` are:

- `call()` and `apply()` invoke the function immediately, while `bind()` returns a new function with the bound context.
- `call()` accepts arguments as individual comma-separated values, whereas `apply()` accepts arguments as an array or array-like object.
- `call()` and `apply()` allow you to pass arguments directly during invocation, while `bind()` allows you to bind arguments in advance and invoke the function later with those bound arguments.

In summary, `call()` and `apply()` are used to invoke a function immediately with a specific context and arguments, while `bind()` is used to create a new function with a bound context, which can be invoked later. -->
