<!-- Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it? -->





<!-- Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class or interface. It allows the same method to be executed in different ways based on the type of object on which it is called. Polymorphism promotes flexibility, extensibility, and code reuse.

The purpose of polymorphism is to enable code to be written in a more generic and flexible manner, allowing objects to be used interchangeably and providing a way to manage different implementations of the same behavior. It allows for the creation of code that can work with a variety of object types, without needing to know the specific implementation details of each object.

Here are a few key aspects and benefits of polymorphism:

1. Method overriding: Polymorphism allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows objects of different subclasses to be treated uniformly through a common interface, while executing the appropriate implementation for each specific subclass.

2. Interface-based programming: Polymorphism is often achieved through interfaces, where multiple classes can implement the same interface and be treated interchangeably. This promotes loose coupling, modular design, and enables code to work with a variety of objects that adhere to the same interface.

3. Code reusability: Polymorphism facilitates code reuse by allowing objects of different classes to be used interchangeably. If multiple classes share a common base class or implement the same interface, they can be substituted wherever the base class or interface is used, reducing code duplication.

4. Extensibility: Polymorphism enables easy extension of functionality by adding new classes that implement existing interfaces or inherit from existing base classes. New classes can be seamlessly integrated into existing code, as long as they adhere to the contract defined by the base class or interface.

5. Runtime determination: Polymorphism allows the determination of the appropriate method implementation to be deferred until runtime. This enables dynamic dispatch, where the method to be executed is determined based on the actual type of the object at runtime, rather than at compile-time.

Polymorphism enhances the flexibility and maintainability of code by promoting a more generic and adaptable design. It allows for code to be written in a way that can accommodate new object types without requiring modifications to existing code. This promotes code extensibility, modularity, and easier evolution of software systems. -->
