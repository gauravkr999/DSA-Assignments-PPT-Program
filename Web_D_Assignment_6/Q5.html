<!-- Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose? -->





<!-- Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features and hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on defining a clear and concise interface for interacting with objects, while hiding the implementation details from the users of the objects. 

The purpose of abstraction is to provide a high-level view of an entity or system, allowing users to understand and interact with it without needing to know the intricate inner workings. It allows programmers to create models or representations of real-world entities as objects, abstracting away the complexities and emphasizing the essential characteristics.

Here are a few key aspects and benefits of abstraction:

1. Reducing complexity: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by providing a simplified and manageable interface. It allows users to work with high-level concepts and ignore the low-level implementation details.

2. Focus on relevant information: Abstraction helps in identifying and focusing on the essential attributes and behaviors of an object or system while hiding irrelevant details. It allows programmers to define the properties and methods that are most relevant to the users.

3. Information hiding: By encapsulating the internal details of an object, abstraction promotes information hiding. The internal implementation details are not exposed, providing better security and preventing unintended modifications.

4. Modularity and maintainability: Abstraction promotes modularity by breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained units. This makes the code easier to understand, modify, and maintain. Changes in the implementation details of an abstracted object have minimal impact on the code that uses it.

5. Code reusability: Abstraction facilitates code reusability by defining abstract classes and interfaces. These can be implemented by multiple classes, allowing for common functionality to be shared and reducing code duplication.

6. Polymorphism: Abstraction plays a crucial role in achieving polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class or interface. Polymorphism enables flexibility in design and allows for interchangeable usage of objects.

In summary, abstraction allows programmers to create simplified models of complex systems, focusing on essential features and hiding implementation details. It provides modularity, maintainability, and code reusability while promoting a clearer understanding of objects and systems. -->
