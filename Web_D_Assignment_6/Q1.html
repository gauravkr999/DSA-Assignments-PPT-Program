<!-- Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose? -->



<!-- In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects of a class. It is called automatically when an object is created from a class and is responsible for setting up the initial state of the object.

The purpose of a constructor is to ensure that the object being created starts in a valid and consistent state by initializing its member variables or properties. It allows you to perform any necessary setup or initialization tasks before the object can be used. Constructors are typically used to assign initial values to instance variables or to perform other setup operations.

Constructors have the same name as the class they belong to and do not have a return type, not even void. They can be overloaded, which means a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This allows objects to be created with different initial configurations or by providing different sets of input values.

By defining constructors, you can control the creation of objects and ensure that they are properly initialized. Constructors play a crucial role in object-oriented programming by facilitating the creation and initialization of objects in a standardized and consistent manner. -->
