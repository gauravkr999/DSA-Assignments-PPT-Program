// Q.2 Why use Express Over NodeJS ?




// Express is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs. When comparing Express to Node.js itself, here are some reasons why you might choose to use Express:

// 1. Simplicity: Express provides a minimalistic and unopinionated approach to web development. It offers a straightforward and intuitive API that is easy to learn and use, making it an excellent choice for developers who prefer simplicity and flexibility.

// 2. Routing: Express includes a powerful routing system that allows you to define routes for different HTTP methods and URLs. This makes it easy to handle different endpoints and HTTP requests, enabling you to build a well-structured and organized application.

// 3. Middleware: Express has built-in middleware support, which simplifies common tasks such as request parsing, logging, error handling, and authentication. Middleware functions can be easily plugged into the request/response pipeline, providing a modular and reusable way to handle common functionalities.

// 4. Ecosystem: Express has a vast and vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of middleware and extensions available. This rich ecosystem provides solutions for various functionalities such as database integration, session management, template engines, and much more. It allows developers to leverage existing modules and libraries to accelerate development and improve productivity.

// 5. Flexibility: Express allows developers to have fine-grained control over the application structure and flow. It doesn't impose strict conventions, allowing you to organize your code and structure the application in a way that best suits your needs. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for complex and customized projects.

// 6. Community and Resources: Express has a large and active community of developers, which means you can easily find help, tutorials, and resources when working with Express. The community actively maintains and updates the framework, ensuring its stability, security, and compatibility with the latest versions of Node.js.

// 7. Performance: Express is known for its lightweight nature, making it performant and efficient. It doesn't add unnecessary overhead or impose heavy abstractions, allowing your application to run quickly and handle a high volume of requests.

// While Node.js provides the core functionality for building web applications, Express enhances it by providing a higher-level framework with additional features, abstractions, and conveniences. Using Express can save you time, simplify development, and provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
