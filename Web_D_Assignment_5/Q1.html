<!-- Q.1 Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous? -->




<!-- Synchronous and asynchronous are two different modes of communication or operation, commonly used in computer systems and networking. Here's the difference between them:

1. Synchronous: In synchronous communication or operation, the sender and receiver are synchronized, meaning they operate in a coordinated manner. In this mode, the sender and receiver must be available at the same time and follow a predetermined timing scheme. The sender sends a message or request, and it waits for the response before proceeding. The sender and receiver have a blocking relationship, where the sender waits for the response before continuing its execution.

An example of synchronous communication is a traditional phone call. When you make a phone call, you speak and listen in real-time, waiting for the other person to respond before you continue the conversation. Similarly, in programming, synchronous operations will block the execution until a response is received, which can sometimes result in delays.

2. Asynchronous: In asynchronous communication or operation, the sender and receiver are not synchronized and can operate independently of each other. In this mode, the sender sends a message or request and doesn't wait for an immediate response. The sender continues its execution or operation while the receiver processes the request separately. The sender and receiver have a non-blocking relationship, meaning they can perform other tasks while waiting for the response.

An example of asynchronous communication is sending an email. You compose an email, send it, and continue with other tasks without waiting for an immediate response. The recipient receives the email and can read and respond to it at their convenience. Similarly, in programming, asynchronous operations allow the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a response, which can improve performance and responsiveness.

In summary, synchronous communication or operation involves a blocking relationship where the sender waits for a response before proceeding, while asynchronous communication or operation involves a non-blocking relationship where the sender continues its execution without waiting for an immediate response. -->
