<!-- Q.9 Explain fetch -->





<!-- `fetch` is a built-in JavaScript function that provides an easy and flexible way to make HTTP requests and interact with web APIs. It allows you to send network requests and handle the responses asynchronously.

Here's an explanation of how `fetch` works and its key features:

1. **Syntax**: The basic syntax for using `fetch` is as follows:

   ```javascript
   fetch(url)
     .then(response => {
       // Handle the response
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle errors
     });
   ```

   In this example, `fetch` is called with the `url` parameter, which represents the URL to which the request is made. It returns a Promise that resolves to a response object.

2. **HTTP Methods**: By default, `fetch` uses the HTTP GET method to retrieve data. However, you can specify other HTTP methods, such as POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., using the optional `init` parameter. This parameter allows you to set additional options for the request, including headers, request body, and more.

   ```javascript
   fetch(url, {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json'
     },
     body: JSON.stringify(data)
   })
   .then(response => {
     // Handle the response
   })
   .catch(error => {
     // Handle errors
   });
   ```

3. **Handling Responses**: The response object returned by `fetch` represents the response to the request made. It provides methods and properties to access and process the response data, such as `json()`, `text()`, `blob()`, etc.

   ```javascript
   fetch(url)
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(data => {
       // Handle the JSON response data
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle errors
     });
   ```

   In this example, `response.json()` is called to extract the JSON data from the response. Similarly, you can use `response.text()` for plain text responses or `response.blob()` for binary data.

4. **Error Handling**: The `.catch()` method is used to handle errors that may occur during the request or response handling. It allows you to catch and handle network errors, server errors, or any other exceptions thrown during the process.

   ```javascript
   fetch(url)
     .then(response => {
       if (!response.ok) {
         throw new Error('HTTP error, status = ' + response.status);
       }
       return response.json();
     })
     .then(data => {
       // Handle the response data
     })
     .catch(error => {
       // Handle errors
     });
   ```

   In this example, if the response status indicates an error (status code outside the 200-299 range), an error is thrown using `throw new Error()`. This triggers the `.catch()` block to handle the error.

`fetch` is widely used in modern web development for making HTTP requests and working with APIs. It is supported in most modern browsers and can also be used in Node.js environments with the help of additional libraries or polyfills. -->
