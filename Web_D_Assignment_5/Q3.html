<!-- Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ? -->




<!-- Both `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are functions provided by JavaScript that allow you to schedule the execution of code after a specified delay. Here's an explanation of each:

1. `setTimeout`: The `setTimeout` function is used to schedule the execution of a function or a piece of code after a specified delay. It takes two arguments: the first argument is the function or code to be executed, and the second argument is the delay in milliseconds before the execution.

Here's an example of using `setTimeout`:

```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('This code will be executed after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).');
}, 2000);
```

In this example, the anonymous function inside `setTimeout` will be executed after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).

2. `setInterval`: The `setInterval` function is used to repeatedly execute a function or a piece of code at a specified interval. It takes two arguments: the first argument is the function or code to be executed, and the second argument is the time interval in milliseconds between each execution.

Here's an example of using `setInterval`:

```javascript
var counter = 0;
var intervalId = setInterval(function() {
  counter++;
  console.log('Counter: ' + counter);
}, 1000);
```

In this example, the anonymous function inside `setInterval` will be executed every 1000 milliseconds (1 second). It increments the `counter` variable and logs its value to the console.

To stop the interval execution, you can use the `clearInterval` function, passing the interval ID returned by `setInterval`:

```javascript
clearInterval(intervalId);
```

Using `setInterval` without clearing it can result in the code executing indefinitely.

In summary, `setTimeout` is used to execute code once after a specified delay, while `setInterval` is used to repeatedly execute code at a specified interval until stopped. -->
