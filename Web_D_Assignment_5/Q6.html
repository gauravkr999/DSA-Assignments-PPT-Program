<!-- Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Methods of Promise -->





<!-- Promises are a feature in JavaScript that provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous operations. A promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allows you to attach callbacks to handle the result or error when the operation is completed.

Promises have three states:

1. **Pending**: The initial state of a promise. It is neither fulfilled nor rejected. The asynchronous operation is still in progress.
2. **Fulfilled**: The state of a promise when the asynchronous operation is successfully completed. The promise is fulfilled with a value.
3. **Rejected**: The state of a promise when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or is rejected intentionally. The promise is rejected with a reason (an error object).

Promises provide several methods to handle the asynchronous operation:

1. **then()**: The `then()` method is used to handle the fulfilled state of a promise. It takes two optional callbacks as arguments: `onFulfilled` and `onRejected`. The `onFulfilled` callback is executed when the promise is fulfilled, receiving the resolved value as an argument. The `onRejected` callback is executed when the promise is rejected, receiving the reason for rejection as an argument.

```javascript
fetchData()
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log('Fulfilled:', data);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error('Rejected:', error);
  });
```

In this example, the `then()` method is used to handle the fulfillment of the promise returned by the `fetchData()` function. The `onFulfilled` callback logs the resolved data, and the `catch()` method is used to handle any rejections.

2. **catch()**: The `catch()` method is used to handle the rejected state of a promise. It is a shorthand for attaching an `onRejected` callback to the `then()` method. It allows you to handle errors and exceptions that occurred during the asynchronous operation.

```javascript
fetchData()
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log('Fulfilled:', data);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error('Rejected:', error);
  });
```

In this example, the `catch()` method is used to handle any rejections that occur during the promise chain.

3. **finally()**: The `finally()` method is used to specify a callback that is executed regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected. It allows you to define cleanup or follow-up actions that should be performed after the asynchronous operation completes.

```javascript
fetchData()
  .then(function(data) {
    console.log('Fulfilled:', data);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error('Rejected:', error);
  })
  .finally(function() {
    console.log('Cleanup or follow-up actions...');
  });
```

In this example, the `finally()` method is used to log a message indicating cleanup or follow-up actions that should be performed regardless of the promise's state.

These are just three commonly used methods of promises (`then()`, `catch()`, and `finally()`). Promises also have other methods, such as `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, and `Promise.resolve()`, that provide additional functionality for handling multiple promises or creating new promises. -->
