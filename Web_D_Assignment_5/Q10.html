<!-- Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await? -->






<!-- To define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using `async/await`, you can prefix the function declaration with the `async` keyword. This tells JavaScript that the function will contain asynchronous code and will return a promise.

Here's an example of defining an asynchronous function using `async/await`:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  // Asynchronous code
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function is defined as an asynchronous function using the `async` keyword. Inside the function, asynchronous code is written using `await`.

The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved. In this case, `await` is used with the `fetch` function to send an HTTP request and wait for the response. The response is then processed using `response.json()`.

Note that the `await` keyword can only be used inside an asynchronous function. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner, making it easier to read and understand.

The function `fetchData` in the above example will return a promise that resolves to the fetched data. You can call this function and handle the result using `.then()` and `.catch()` as you would with any other promise.

Here's an example of calling the `fetchData` function:

```javascript
fetchData()
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function is called, and the result is handled using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods to log the data or any errors that occur.

By using `async/await`, you can write asynchronous code in a more sequential and readable manner, avoiding the need for explicit callbacks or chaining `.then()` methods. -->
