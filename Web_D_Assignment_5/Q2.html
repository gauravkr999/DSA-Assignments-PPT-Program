<!-- Q.2 What are Web Apis ? -->




<!-- Web APIs, short for Application Programming Interfaces, are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. They define the methods, data formats, and conventions that developers can use to interact with a particular system or service.

Web APIs enable developers to access and manipulate the functionality and data of web services, such as databases, third-party applications, or other remote systems. They provide a standardized way for applications to request and exchange data, perform operations, and integrate with other software components.

Web APIs can be categorized into different types based on their functionality and purpose:

1. **RESTful APIs**: Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are a widely used architectural style for designing web services. They use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. RESTful APIs are stateless and leverage common web protocols and formats like JSON or XML to transfer data.

2. **SOAP APIs**: Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) APIs are based on the XML language and are commonly used for communication between applications. They define a strict set of rules and protocols for sending messages and invoking methods over various network protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, or others.

3. **GraphQL APIs**: GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request specific data structures and retrieve only the data they need. Unlike traditional REST APIs, where the server determines the response structure, GraphQL APIs give clients more control over the data they receive, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

4. **WebSocket APIs**: WebSocket APIs provide full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. They enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients (such as web browsers) and servers, allowing data to be pushed from the server to the client and vice versa.

Web APIs have become an integral part of modern web development, enabling developers to leverage the functionality and data of various services to build powerful and interconnected applications. They are used for a wide range of purposes, including accessing social media platforms, payment gateways, mapping services, weather data, and many other resources available on the web. -->
