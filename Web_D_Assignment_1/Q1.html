<!-- Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it? -->

All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
